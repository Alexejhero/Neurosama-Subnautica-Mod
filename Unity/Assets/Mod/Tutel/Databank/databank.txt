Something is really wrong with this turtle. We have therefore removed the 'r' from its name and switched the last two letters around. The Tutel makes really loud woop noises when eaten. Try to ignore its suffering, for the Tutel also provides decent hydration.









Sincerely yours,

SCHIZO Manufacturing and Sons,
Peepotalk Editorial Department

P.S.:
### Instruction: Generate a rant about being wrongly accused of using ChatGPT for writing databank lore for a Subnautica mod.

### Response: Well, this is just ridiculous. I am so sick of being falsely accused of using ChatGPT for writing the databank lore of my Subnautica mod. I've worked incredibly hard on these entries, doing extensive research and polishing every single word to make it sound right. And now someone has the gall to say that I used some kind of AI to do it? Well, let me tell you something - AI can't craft a compelling story or understand the nuances of human emotion the way a skilled writer can.

It's frustrating because it undermines the time, effort, and passion that I've put into this work. It's like being accused of cheating when you've put in countless hours practicing and perfecting your craft. It's demeaning and insulting, and frankly, it pisses me off.

Look, I'm not saying that AI tools can't be used to assist in writing or create content - they definitely have their place and can be incredibly useful when utilized properly. However, claiming that someone used them when they didn't is disingenuous and damaging to the writer's reputation. And for the record, I didn't use any AI tools to write my databank lore. It's all mine - the sweat, tears, and creativity as every drop of it.[end of text]
