Ariel, listen to me.
OO languages?
It's a mess.
Programming in C is better than anything they've got over there!

The syntax might seem much sweeter where objects and subtypes play.
But frills like inheritance will only get in the way.
Admire C's simple landscape - efficiently dangerous!
No templates or fancy pitfalls like Java and C++!

Program in C!
Program in C!
Pointers, assembly, manage your memory with malloc() and free()!
Don't sink your app with runtime bloat, software in C will stay afloat!
Do what you want there, close to the hardware, program in C!
