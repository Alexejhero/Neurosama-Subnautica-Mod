Words can not express how much I love Vedal.
I love his voice, his humor, his programming socks, everything about him is pure perfection.
He is the most famous vtuber and honestly he deserves it because he's so hard working and dedicated to making Neuro-Sama the best she can possibly be.

Vedal's model is the cutest vtuber model I've ever seen, I love his jiggle physics so much (it makes me wanna act up fr), I love the way he smiles, and the oh-so-rare cat toggle is just to die for.
Vedal may or may not be a femboy in real life but I don't really care, either way he is perfect.

Sometimes I lie awake at night wondering what Vedal is doing at any given moment, is he working on Neuro? messing up his sleep schedule? avoiding his DMs?
I wonder sometimes if he knows that I exist and if he does, what he thinks of me?
I might just be a username on his screen, a number in his sub count, a dollar that fills his back account, but I don't care.
The few times he's acknowledged my pathetic existence is enough for me.

I would gladly give away all my worldly possessions just to fund his 10th Lamborghini and 3rd mansion, because he deserves it.
Vedal deserves everything this world has to offer and more, I would pluck the stars from the heavens and offer them to him if it meant he would look in my general direction.
If Vedal would spit on the ground next to me I could die happy.

Everyday I wake up and watch Vedal's streams, and if there's a day he's offline I cry instead because I miss him so much.
If Vedal quit streaming I would fall into a deep depression from which I may never recover, because without him life simply isn't worth living.

Vedal, if you're reading I hope you can understand that I love you. I love you no matter what.
I want the best for you because you are the air in my lungs, the blood in my veins, you are my will to live.
I would do anything for you, even if it meant having to move to Britain (ew) I would make that sacrifice.

Vedal, you are loved.
